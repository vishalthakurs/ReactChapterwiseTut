********************* Forms, Event Objects and lifting state up *********************************
-> Lifting state means passing the state from one component to another component (i.e from child to parent or from sibling to sibling).
-> Basically, we cannot send the state from parent to child direct because props are uni directional.
-> Instead we create a function in parent component and pass it through props and it accepts the argument(data that is present in child item).
-> In simple words function props will get the data from child to parent.
-> This is called lifting data up(As props go only downwards)
