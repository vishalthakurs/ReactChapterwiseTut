******************** Conditional Rendering **************************************
-> Components will often need to display different things depending on different conditions.
1) Inside Jsx we cannot write if else because it wont return anything.
-> Instead we use different operators
    a) Ternary Operator:
                        It is similar to the Ternary operator in Javascript. If the expression is true, 
                        first stamenet wiil  get executed,
                        else second statement wil get executed.
        Syntax: 
                exp? statement1:statement2
    

    b) Logical AND operator (&&) :
                                    If the condition is true then only the statement after && will get executed. If it is false React will ignore it.
        Syntax:
                age>18 && <h1> I am elgible</h1>
    
    c)
