-> useRef is a React Hook that lets you reference  a value that's not needed for reandering.
-> In simple words, whenever there is a change in useRef value unlike useState hook it doesn't re-rendered.
-> useRef() returns one item. It returns one object called current.


Uses:
    In general, we let react handle all Dom manipulations. But there are some instances , when useRef can be used without Causing issues.
    In React, we can add 'ref' attribute to an element to access it directly in the Dom

    Ex: use useRef to focus on input:

    import React, {useRef} from React

    const App=()=>{
        const inputElement=useRef();
        const focusInput=()=>{
            inputElement.current.focus();

        }
        return (
            <>
            <input type='text' ref={inputElement} />
            <button onClick={focusInput} />
            </>
        )
    }
