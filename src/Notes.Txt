**************************************** State ******************************************************
-> Basically, component doesn't get rerendered when ever variable changes. It gets re-rendered(updated) when state changes.
-> state is nothing but a variable that holds a value.
-> Hooks:
        Hooks are nothing but the functional components using which we can perform operations with out writing a class.
        Every hook starts with use.

Rules for using hooks:
1) First import the hook from library.
2) Hooks should be used inside component only.
3) Hooks shouldn't be used in class components.

a) useState():
                -> useState() hook is a function given by React.
                -> usState() returns an array of two elements.
                        1) elements
                        2) function
                -> with the help of useState(), we can store the data inside the variable.
                -> First argument is to store the data, second arguement (i.e function) is to modify the data.
                -> we have to use array destructuring concepy
                        i.e const [count,setCount]=useState(0)   // 0 is the defaul value.


*******Note***:
                -> when ever there is a change in the state, the component gets re rendered(i.e component gets updated)
