        Inside reducer function it accepts two arguements
            a) state
            b) action
        Based on action type we perform the operation and return the state.
    2) Initial State is the data with out any modifications
-> It returns destructured array of two things:
        1) state: on which operation performed
        2) disptach: To define which action to be performed.
