*************************************** Events And Event Handling *****************************************************

-> Events are nothing but the tasks or the acions.
-> Events which are handled by functions are called event handling functions.
->React lets you add event handlers to your JSX. Event handlers are your 
  own functions that will be triggered in response to user interactions like clicking, hovering, focusing on form inputs, and so on.

-> In React we use events in camelCase.
-> If we pass function directly, then it will get executed when the page renders
        i.e onClick={handleClick()};

-> To avoid the above problem we should only definfe the function or pass arrow function
        i.e onClick={handleclick}
        i.e onClick={()=>handleClick()};




-> we can also pass the functions as props.
